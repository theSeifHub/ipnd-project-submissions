### About this project
In this project, you'll apply Python and object-oriented programming skills learned through the nanodegree, to build a program that plays the game of Rock Paper Scissors. You'll build classes that represent the game and its players. You'll write computer players that follow various different strategies, as well as a human player class that lets a human play the game against the computer.

You'll start this project with a piece of starter code that doesn't quite know how to play Rock Paper Scissors yet. In fact, it contains a computer player class that only knows how to play rock. From that humble beginning, you will add classes and modify methods, expanding it into a full game. You'll use the input function to read the human player's moves from the keyboard, and print the results of each round. You'll use subclasses to build more intelligent computer players. And you'll test your code at every step by running your program, or by importing it to test specific functions and methods.

### Project initial instructions from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com)
1. Download the [starter code](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/November/5c002226_rps-starter-code/rps-starter-code.py)
2. Create a player subclass that plays randomly
3. Keep score
4. Create a subclass for a human player
5. Create player classes that remember
6. Validate user input
7. Announce the winner
8. Check your code formatting

### How to run the original game
1. If you don't have Pyhton installed on your machine, [Install the latest version](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download `rps_code.py` and `rpssl_code.py` from this repo
3. Open the directory in which you downloaded the file on your machine
4. Open a command line interface (Shell session) in the directory
5. Depending on your installed python version:
	* run either `python rps_code.py` or `python3 rps_code.py` on your command line (for the original gameplay)
	* run either `python rpssl_code.py` or `python3 rpssl_code.py` on your command line (for the extended version gameplay)
6. Follow the intstructions to play the game
7. Type `quit` at anytime to exit game

Project submitted and passed the review.
#### [Graduated](https://confirm.udacity.com/JHJYNSLG) the nanodegree program sucessfully on November 11, 2018
